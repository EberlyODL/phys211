## Lesson Objectives for week 2A

Now we are ready to look at the accelerated motion like the rocket car video we started the class with. 

* LOKin03: distinguish & relate position, velocity and acceleration using slopes/derivatives and areas/integrals of functions with respect to time
* LOKin04: relate and create time dependent plots of kinematic variables
* LOKin07: apply kinematics to oscillations where the acceleration is not constantÂ
