1. Acceleration and Velocity in one dimension

page 14 in your book discusses the common sign confusions relating to acceleration and velocity. Be careful with the words speeding up and slowing down. Also be careful with speed vs velocity! These words have different physical meaning!

* **Speed:** The magnitude the velocity vector
* **Velocity:** includes both the magnitude and the velocity. 

2. Vector addition and subtraction.

We will return to the 2 dimensional case in Chap 3. For the moment, we are only asking you to do addition and subtraction in one dimension.

The geometric arrow can be confusing. Here is a trick! Just replace the arrows with numbers. vector A would be +4 while vector B would be -3. 

What is A+B and what is A -B? Much easier with numbers right?
