## Metacognition. 

Metacognition is like having your brain looking from the outside at your own brain. Its the ability to think about one's own thinking.

The 5 steps to take ownership of your learning and to think about your thinking (and learning) are

### **Assess**: 

You need to assess the task. What is required of you, what is the level of skills that will be needed. Is remembering enough or will you need to apply and analyze?

Look 


**Evaluate**: Figure out your strengths and weaknesses. What do you already have? What are you missing?
**Plan**: Accounting for the current situation, given time constraints make the best plan to do the task at the level required.
**Apply** and **Monitor**: Apply strategies (see below) and monitor continuously your performance.
**Reflect**: Reflect on your performance, restart the cycle, re-assess the talk, evaluate and plan.
