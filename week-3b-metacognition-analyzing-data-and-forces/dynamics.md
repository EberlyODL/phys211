Kinematics was about describing motion quantitatively given a known acceleration.

We studied multiple examples of motion ranging from uniform motion (zero acceleration) to free all and projectile motion (with an acceleration of g downward). But why are some objects accelerated while others are not? What causes motion?

### Dynamics

We now move to dynamics which aims to explain what causes motion and we will start by introducing the concept of forces. 

In the following video, I will demonstrate many of the forces we will discuss in this class.
