Kinematics was about describing motion quantitatively given a known acceleration.

We studied multiple examples of motion ranging from uniform motion (zero acceleration) to free all and projectile motion (with an acceleration of g downward). But why are some objects accelerated while others are not? What causes motion?

### Dynamics

We now move to dynamics which aims to explain what causes motion and we will start by introducing the concept of forces. 

In the following video, I will demonstrate many of the forces we will discuss in this class.

Read Chapter 5 carefully. It is very wordy but these are very important concepts.

Tactics Box 5.2 and Tactics Box 5.3 are crucial to master for the rest of the course. Practice both by looking at example 5.5 and 5.6 (and the reading quiz). Also look again at the mathematical aside on proportional reasoning.
