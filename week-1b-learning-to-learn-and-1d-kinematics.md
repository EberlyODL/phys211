 In this half-week, we will start the subject of kinematics. 
 
 Kinematics is about representing and describing motion quantitatively. The simplest is one-dimensional motion at constant velocity. 
 
 Before we look into this, I would like to spend the equivalent of what would be a full 50 minutes lecture in face-to-face to discussing **Learning Strategies**

## Lesson Objectives for week 1B

The "learning to learn" part of this lesson addresses the following objectives

* LOGen01: read a physics textbook using paraphrasing and do the examples without looking at solutions. 
* LOGen02: apply proper time management and self-study skills (due dates are enforced). 
* LOGen03: discuss physics effectively in asynchronous discussion boards.
* LOGen04: define the five steps of metacognition: assess, evaluate, plan, apply, reflect.  
* LOGen05: differentiate deep processing from shallow processing.
* LOGen06: identify and define the four principles of deep processing: elaboration, distinctiveness, personal and appropriate.

And then going back to physics we will see. 

* LOKin02: understand & differentiate between average and instantaneous quantities
* LOKin03: distinguish & relate position, velocity and acceleration using slopes/derivatives and areas/integrals of functions with respect to time 
* LOKin04: relate and create time dependent plots of kinematic variables 
* LOPro05: differentiate and integrate polynomial functions 

The full list of objectives can be found on Canvas. The reading for this week is Chap 2.1-2.3 of the textbook but read these course content pages until you get the "read the textbook sign".

We will start doing derivatives and integral right away even if you are taking math 140 concurrently. This chapter explains what derivatives and integral are and we will mostly only use them on polynomials. We will get to practice it, don't worry!
