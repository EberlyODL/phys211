 In this half-week, we will start the subject of kinematics. 
 
 Kinematics is about representing and describing motion quantitatively. The simplest is one-dimensional motion at constant velocity. 
 
 Before we look into this, I would like to spend the equivalent of what would be a full 50 minutes lecture in face-to-face to discussing **Learning Strategies**
