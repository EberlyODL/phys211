## Moment of inertia and Kinetic energy of rotation

The moment of inertia measures how hard it is to rotate an object from a given axis of rotation. 

The same object will have _different_ moment of inertia with respect to different axis.

### No Memorization

We do no expect you to memorize or to derive from integrals different moment of inertia. 

They have been calculated for you and we would give them to you in general.

 We can ask you to find the moment of inertia about an axis that is displaced but parallel from an axis on this table. In this case, you need to use the parallel axis theorem (p.303).

### Torque

The last new concept with rotational motion is the concept of torque.
