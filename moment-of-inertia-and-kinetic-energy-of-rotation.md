The moment of inertia measure how hard it is to rotate an object from a given axis of rotation. 

The same object will have _different_ moment of inertia with respect to different axis.

### No Memorization

We do no expect you to memorize or to derive from integrals different moment of inertia. 

They have been calculated for you and we would give them to you in general.

Â We can ask for situation where the moment of inertia is a about an axis that is displaced but parallel from an axis on this table. In this case, you need to use the parallel axis theorem (p.303).
