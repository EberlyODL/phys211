As you saw in the last question, the centripetal force is not a new special force. The centripetal force refers to the net force in circular motion which must always be in the same direction as the acceleration, toward the center. This is why we use the word "centripetal".

For a coin on a turntable that is not sliding, the static friction must be the centripetal force.

Here is another example of circular motion, the spinning centrifuge or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_death" target="_blank">"wall of death"</a>

If we do a free-body diagram of the mass spinning in the centrifuge it looks like this

This is almost the same as the coin on the turntable but with friction and normal forces reversed. Now the normal force is the centripetal force!

For a car on banked road, the centripetal force will be a combination of the normal force and the static friction force. ** Look carefully at your reading quiz on the subject**.

To repeat, we will not often use the word centripetal force since it is not a new type of force. The forces that cause circular motion are the same forces that we saw before. Circular motion only requires that the net force be in the direction of the center of the circle.

Because both of the previous examples involve static friction, you may guess that something special will happen if the maximum static friction is exceeded.
