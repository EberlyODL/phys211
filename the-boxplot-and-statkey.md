## How do we make sense of data?

Physics is an experimental science in which we make measurements and try to make sense of the data taken. Because of natural variations in the phenomenon and because of the measurements techniques, the numbers we collect generally vary. We will need to make conclusions by looking at an ensemble of data points. To do so we look at patterns and we use statistics. 

In this class, we will not assume any prior knowledge of statistics and we will not require detailed statistical calculations. Instead we will focus on knowing a few important concepts and we will focus on using statistical tools to visualize and compute for us all the important properties of our dataset. 

For example here is a data set of the age students in an online course (this is fake, just an example). The students are marked whether they attend the World campus or the University Park campus. 

| Age       | WC or UP           | 
| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
| 19     | up | 
| 20      | up |   
| 17 | up |    
| 17     | up | 
| 18      | up |   
| 65 | up |
| 26     | up | 
| 25      | wc |   
| 40 | wc |
| 42      | wc | 
| 65 | wc |
| 30 | wc |
| 27 | wc |

Given this set of data, it looks like the UP students are younger than the WC students but it would be nice to be more precise.

In this class we will primarily use StatKey. <a href="http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/" target="_blank">StatKey</a> which is a free Javascript application that is used with the textbook "Statistics: Unlocking the Power of Data". 

The first visual tool, we will learn is the box plot shown below.
