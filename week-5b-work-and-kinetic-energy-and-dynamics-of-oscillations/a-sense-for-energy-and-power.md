## Getting a sense of energy and power

Energy takes many different forms. As we have discussed, energy can be stored in the system as potential energy. This can be chemical energy of molecular bonds, nuclear energy of nuclear bonds, electric energy, gravitational energy, etc. 

Energy is a real thing even though you cannot see it. It can be counted. Let us get a feeling for some energy values. 

Look at the table below - it shows the amount of usable (extractable) energy a 1 gram mass of each object has. Isn't it strange that chocolate chip cookies have more "usable energy" than TNT? Why, then, is dynamite so much more dangerous than cookies? The key difference is how fast the energy is released, and this has to do with power. Look at the table below. It has some very interesting numbers.

| Object | Calories | Joules | Compared to TNT | Type of Energy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Moving Bullet | 0.01 | 40 J | 0.015 | Kinetic |
| Computer Battery | 0.1 | 400 J | 0.15 | Electric |
| TNT | 0.651 | 2723 J | 1 | Chemical |
| Chocolate Chip Cookies | 5 | 21 kJ | 8 | Chemical |
| Butter | 7 | 29 kJ | 11 | Chemical |
| Anthracite Coal | 7.2 | 30 kJ | 11 | Chemical |
| Gasoline | 10 | 42 kJ | 15 | Chemical |
| Asteroid or Meteor \(30km/s\) | 107 | 450 kJ | 165 | Kinetic |
| Uranium | 20 million | 84 billion J | 30 million | Nuclear |

The energy per gram is written in different units. You may already know the Calorie. We often use the kilowatt-hour abbreviated kWh in our electricity meters outside of our houses. Electric companies sell us energy in kWh. One kWh is 1000 watt-hour \(Wh\) and we have that approximately

1 Wh = 1 Calorie. \(approximately\)

Up to now we have been using the SI unit of Joules.

4200 Joules = 1 Calorie  
3600 Joules = 1 Wh

As you can see from the table, for the same mass of fuel, uranium is the big winner. The energy that is accessible in uranium is the binding energy between neutrons and protons in the nucleus. 

### Power

Power is the rate of energy release. It is the amount of energy that you can release over the time it takes to release it.

Power = Energy/Time

Usain Bolt has a high power when he sprints the 100 meters in less than 10 seconds. The unit for power is the Watt. If you have 1 watt-hour of energy that you release in 1 hour, your power is 1 watt \(just divide 1-watt-hour by 1 hour\).

TNT has less energy per gram than cookies but it has a high power. TNT is made to release its energy very quickly. TNT explodes while chocolate chip cookies require more time to release all their energy.

## How Much and Power?


| Value | Equivalent | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 watt \(W\) | 1 joule per second | flashlight |
| 100 watts | 100 joules per second | Bright light bulb |
| 1 horsepower \(hp\) | 1 kilowatt | Typical horse |
| 20 hp | 20 kilowatt | Small automobile |
| 1 megawatt \(1MW\) | 1 million watts | Electric power for a small town |
| 1 gigawatt \(1 GW\) | 1 billion watt | Large coal, gas or nuclear power plant. |
