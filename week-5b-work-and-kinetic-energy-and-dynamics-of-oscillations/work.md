### Reading guide Chap 9: 

This chapter contains a lot of new material, all of which is important. 

The first section overviews the basic energy model which we will learn over two weeks. The box "Model 9.1" is very important to constantly keep in mind. 

It then goes to the definition of work, thermal energy and power. 

There are two "aside" that on this chapter that are important. These two concepts are not directly related to energy. 

* the dot product between vectors. This is math. Probably new so we will practice it a lot. 
* Hooke's Law. This is really a new force, the spring force. We could have done this in Chap 6 but there was enough new stuff by then so its here now. This force is variable, it changes as the stretching/compressing changes.  

There are 13 worked examples. As usual, these are all important problems including the very last one, the "challenge". Make sure you do without looking at solutions.
