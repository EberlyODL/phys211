### Reading guide Chap 9: 

This chapter contains a lot of new material, all of which is important. 

The first section overviews the basic energy model which we will learn over two weeks. The box "Model 9.1" is very important to constantly keep in mind. 

It then goes to the definition of work, thermal energy and power. 

There are two "aside" on this chapter that are important. 

* the dot product between vectors. This is just math. 
* Hooke's Law. This is really a new force, the spring force. We could have done this in Chap 6 but there was enough new stuff by then so its here now.
