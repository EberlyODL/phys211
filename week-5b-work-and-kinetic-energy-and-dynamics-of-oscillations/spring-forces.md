Most springs are well modeled by Hooke's Law

<lrn-math inline> (F_{sp})_s = -k\Delta d </lrn-math>

In this relationship, it is super important to remember that there is really two terms since <lrn-math inline>\Delta s =s -s_e </lrn-math> where <lrn-math inline>s_e </lrn-math> is the equilibrium value. The equilibrium value of the spring is not always zero.

we have seen springs already

The formula for work comes from integrating the variable spring force. Look at formula 9.25 in the book. Not that the formula involves the square of the change in position 

<lrn-math inline> (\Delta s_f)^2 </lrn-math> not <lrn-math inline>s_f^2 </lrn-math> and similarly for initial displacement. 

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
Again a common mistake is to forget the equilibrium position <lrn-math inline>s_e </lrn-math>
