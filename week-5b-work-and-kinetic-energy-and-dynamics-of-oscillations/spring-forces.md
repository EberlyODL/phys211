Most springs are well modeled by Hooke's Law

<lrn-math inline> (F_{sp})_s = -k\Delta d </lrn-math>

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
In this relationship, it is super important to remember that there is really two terms since <lrn-math inline>\Delta s =s -s_e </lrn-math> where <lrn-math inline>s_e </lrn-math> is the equilibrium value. The equilibrium value of the spring is not always zero.
