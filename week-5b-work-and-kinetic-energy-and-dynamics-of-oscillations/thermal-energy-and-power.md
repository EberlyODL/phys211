To recap, we can show from Newton's second law <lrn-math inline>(F_{net})_s = ma_s </lrn-math> that  

<lrn-math inline> W = \Delta K </lrn-math>

with the work calculated by integrating the force along the path <lrn-math inline>W=\int (F_{net})_s ds </lrn-math>.

But as the latest question has shown, this does not seem to always be correct. 

Let us look more in detail. In the problem shown below, both block A and block B will speed up (assuming no friction). The system of both blocks will increase their energy but yet the net force on the system is zero since the two forces F cancels.

The problem is that the system is not just a single particle but has multiple parts and that these parts move independently. 

The system is "deformable" and energy can be put into the deformation.

We will not be analyzing "deformable" system in this course. You should just be aware that such issues can arise. It also makes it easier to understand why we need to go beyond Newton's second law when looking at energy.
