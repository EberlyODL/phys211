To recap, we can show from Newton's second law <lrn-math inline>(F_{net})_s = ma_s </lrn-math> that  

<lrn-math inline> W = \Delta K </lrn-math>

with the work calculated by integrated the force along the path <lrn-math inline>W=\int (F_{net})_s ds </lrn-math>.

But as the latest question as shown, this does not seem to always be correct. In the problem shown below. Both block A and Block B will speed up (assuming no friction
