To recap, we can show from Newton's second law <lrn-math inline>(F_{net})_s = ma_s </lrn-math> that  

<lrn-math inline> W = \Delta K </lrn-math>

with the work calculated by integrated the force along the path <lrn-math inline>W=\int (F_{net})_s ds </lrn-math>.

But as the latest question has shown, this does not seem to always be correct. 

Let us look more in detail. In the problem shown below, both block A and block B will speed up (assuming no friction). The system of both blocks will increase their energy but yet the net force on the system is zero since the two forces F cancels.

The problem is that the system is not just a single particle but has multiple parts and that these parts move independently.
