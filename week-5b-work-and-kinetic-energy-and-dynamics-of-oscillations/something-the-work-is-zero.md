In order to do work, the point of application of the force must move.

In circular motion, many of the forces are perpendicular to the    displacement and the work done by these forces is always zero. 

Since the normal force is almost always perpendicular to the displacement, it also does zero work.  

### Variable force

If the force varies, the work done is the integral of the force over the line it it applied (over position).

Most of the forces we have seen in this class are constant. The most important variable force is the spring force to which we now turn.
