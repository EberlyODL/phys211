Not much say about drag beyond the book and chapter summary. The formula is

 <lrn-math inline> \vec{D} = \left(\frac12 C\rho A v^2,\;\rm{direction}\;\rm{opposite}\;\rm{to};\rm{motion}\right) </lrn-math>
 
The coefficient of drag C and <lrn-math inline>\rho </lrn-math> would be given in any particular problem (you are not supposed to remember). The area A is the cross section area. 

For example, a cylinder falling down has C = 1.1 and <lrn-math inline>A = 2\pi r l </lrn-math>.

The most important concept about drag is that it depends on the velocity square and that it can lead to terminal velocity. At terminal velocity, the acceleration is zero, therefore you can use Newton's law to find the drag force, you may not need the complicated formulae above.
