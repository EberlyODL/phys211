Not much say about drag beyond the book and chapter summary. The formula is

 <lrn-math> \vec{D} = \left(\frac12 C\rho A v^2,\;\rm{direction}\;\rm{opposite}\;\rm{to};\rm{motion}\right) </lrn-math>
 
The coefficient of drag C and <lrn-math>\rho </lrn-math> would be given in any particular problem (you are not supposed to remember). The area A is the cross section area. 

For example, a cylinder falling down has C = 1.1 and <lrn-math>A = 2\pi r l </lrn-math>.

The most important concept about drag is that it depends on the velocity square and opposes motion. The drag will increase has object speed up but only up to a point called the  terminal velocity. At terminal velocity, the acceleration is zero, therefore you can use Newton's law to find the drag force, you may not need the complicated formulae above.
