Energy consideration allows one to solve many problems much faster and with a greater depth of understanding as to the why things are happening. 

For example.

When a ball rolls on a track, rolling friction tend to be really small and is often negligible. The normal force is always perpendicular to the motion and does no work. Therefore balls rolling on track are good example of places where we can look at transfers of energy between kinetic and gravitational potential.
