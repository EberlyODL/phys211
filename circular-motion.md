There is nothing new in this chapter in terms of theory. Dynamics of circular motion can be tricky and confusing but you must always remember. 

* There are no new forces. ** Do no invent forces, always use the same method to identify forces**
* the acceleration is known in uniform circular motion. It is toward the center and the magnitude is 

<lrn-math inline>a_r = \frac{v^2}{r} </lrn-math>

Do not get confused by the circular motion when identifying forces. You should forget about the motion when identifying forces. What is the object touching, you get contact forces for those and thats it.
