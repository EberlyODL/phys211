As in all parts of the course, your primary source of information is the book. Make sure to read carefully and do the worked out example without looking at the solution first. Examples 8.3 and 8.4 and surrounding text are crucial and they will not be discussed anywhere else. STOP at the end of section 8.4. We will not do section 8.5 until later.

### Circular Motion

There is nothing new in chapter 8 in terms of theory. Dynamics of circular motion can be tricky and confusing but you must always remember. 

* There are no new forces. **Do not invent forces, always use the same method to identify forces**
* The acceleration is known in uniform circular motion. It is toward the center and the magnitude is 

<lrn-math>a_r = \frac{v^2}{r} </lrn-math>

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
Do not get confused by the circular motion when identifying forces. You do as before, first find what is the object touching, you get contact forces for those, then add gravity and thats it.

Here is an example of circular motion. This is just a "coin", really a weighted mass, on a turntable.
