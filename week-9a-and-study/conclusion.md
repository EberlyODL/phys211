## To conclude. 

We have seen a lot in this course but this is just the surface and there is so much more to the Universe!

We finished with the force of gravity. The next course Phys 212 will start very similarly with the force of electricity which has a very similar form. 

<lrn-math> F_e = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2} </lrn-math> where q are elecric charge. 

Just like gravity we can define a potential energy (which also goes like 1/r). 

One may be tempted to think that the force of gravity is the most important force for humankind but in fact we can live fine and relatively well in deep space with negligible force of gravity. 

The electric force on the other hand is absolutely essential not only for atoms and molecules to stay together but for all the technology that now permeates every we do. 

### Let me finish with a little farewell!

Come back for Phys 212!
