### Metacognition and becoming a self-directed learner

Metacognition is like having your brain looking from the outside at your own brain. Its the ability to think about one's own thinking.

Novice in a field tend to be overconfident on their mastery of the material. This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect. * I have seen this so many times!

To be a successful student, you need to think about your own thinking, here is a good process to remember. 

* **Assess**: You need to assess the task. What is required of you, what is the level of skills that will be needed. Is remembering enough or will you need to apply and analyze?
* **Evaluate**: Figure out your strengths and weaknesses. What do you already have? What are you missing?
* ** Plan**: Accounting for the current situation, given time constraints make the best plan to do the task at the level required. 
* ** Apply** and **Monitor**: Apply strategies (see below) and monitor continuously your performance. 
* ** Reflect**: Reflect on your performance, restart the cycle, re-assess the talk, evaluate and plan.

### Shallow versus Deep Learning

Which of the following is the MOST important ingredient for successful learning? 

1.  The intention and desire to learn 
2.  Paying close atenttion to the material as you 
study 
3.  Learning in a way that matches your  personal Learning Style? 
4.  The time you spend studying 
5.  What you think about while studying 

Here is a cognitive experiment. 24 words are read, some of the participants are told to make a mental note if the word contain an E or a G. Others are told to make a mental note if they find the word pleasant or unpleasant. After the 24 words are read, each group has to recall as many words as they can. They all paid attention, they all tried hard but because of the instructions the participants were force to do shallow or deep processing of the words.

Here are the results of the experiment.

What you were thinking when studying completely change how much you learn. You internalized the information and achieved deeper processing by connecting the material to your emotions. 

### How to achieve deep Processing. 

Just reading with music on or doing problem quickly or googling is shallow processing and mostly a waste of your time. It is better to spend less time but actually use that time to really process the information.

As you study, follow these principles
* **Elaboration**: How does this concept relate to other concepts?
* ** Distinctiveness**: How is this concept different from other concepts. 
* ** Personal**: How can I relate this to my personal experience? Stop yourself and think about that. 
* **Appropriate to retrieval and application**: Ask yourself what you are expected to be able to do with the information.
