A velocity of <lrn-math>v_x = +10\;m/s</lrn-math> means that you move 10 m to the right x direction in every second. If you started at x = 0, you would be at x = 10 m in one second. 

An acceleration of <lrn-math>a_y = -10\;m/s^2</lrn-math> means that your velocity increase in the negative y direction by 10 m/s every second. If you started with <lrn-math>v_y = 0</lrn-math>, you would have <lrn-math>v_y = -10\;m/s</lrn-math> after 1 second.

### Position, Velocity, Acceleration

Almost all of 1 D kinematics can be summarized in the following figure.

These are the **general** definitions that relates position, velocity and acceleration. 

In the following demonstration, we illustrate an interesting one dimensional motion with a small fan placed on a small cart. There is negligible friction between the cart and the ramp.
