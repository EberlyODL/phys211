Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity just like the velocity is the rate of change of position. Make sure you understand what this means in words.

A velocity of $v_x = +10 m/s$ means that you move 10 m to the right x direction in every second. If you started at x = 0, you would be at x = 10 m in one second. 

An acceleration of $a_y = -10 m/s^2$ means that you velocity increase in the negative y direction by 10 m/s every second. If you started with $v_y = 0$, you would have $v_y = -10 m/s$ after 1 second.
