The scientific method is not a straightforward clean path of incremental progress toward the truth. It has twists and turns. Scientists must often stop to revise or rethink. 

The basic starting point of science is ignorance. This is what makes science method special and different from other dogma. 

Before the scientific revolution, if you had a question about the world, you would go ask your local priest. They would know many universal truth about ethics astronomy, economics and even the weather. The more verse in theology, the priest was, the more answers they had. 

If your question was about a mundane fact of life such as why does light turn into color after going thru a prism. The priest would not know the answer but not because the knowledge is not out there. God knew the answer but the question was too irrelevant to humans and had just not been revealed to us. 

A scientist before Newton (there were only a few) would answer differently.  They would freely admit ignorance claiming that the question is unknown, this phenomena needs to be explored and understood better. 

Science starts with the premise that nothing in the Universe is known (or at least known for certain). We must figure it out and it starts with observations and explorations of the phenomena to detect patterns and regularities. These patterns allow one to propose an hypothesis for an underlying cause. Experiments can then be designed to test the hypothesis. The tests often go like this. Given this experimental design, the hypothesis predicts such and such. If such and such is happening or not, how confident are we about the experimental setup, the veracity of the hypothesis or any other underlying assumptions? 

The hypothesis is either rejected (or modified) if it keeps failing or the text continues.

 In this first part of the class, we will do observing experiment. 
 
 design experiment to observe phenomena, find patterns, take and analyze data. Which variables to plot? Which variables to keep fixed?
