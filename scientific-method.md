### Ignorance

The scientific method is not a straightforward clean path of incremental progress toward the truth. It has twists and turns. Scientists must often stop to revise or rethink. 

The basic starting point of science is ignorance. This is what makes the science method special and different from other dogma. 

Before the scientific revolution, if you had a question about the world, you would go ask your local priest. They would know many universal truths about ethics, astronomy, economics and even the weather. The more verse in theology, the priest was, the more answers they had. 

If your question was about a mundane fact of life such as why does light turn into color after going thru a prism. The priest would not know the answer but not because the knowledge is not out there. God knew the answer but the question was too irrelevant to human societies and had just not been revealed to us. 

A scientist before Newton (there were only a few) would answer differently.  They would freely admit ignorance and just state that this phenomena needs to be explored and understood better. 

Science starts with the premise that nothing in the Universe is known (or at least known for certain). We must figure it out and it starts with observations and explorations of the phenomena to detect patterns and regularities. These patterns allow one to propose an hypothesis for an underlying cause. Experiments can then be designed to test the hypothesis. The tests often go like this. Given this experimental design, the hypothesis predicts such and such. If such and such is happening or not, how confident are we about the experimental setup, the veracity of the hypothesis or any other underlying assumptions? 

The hypothesis is either rejected (or modified) if it keeps failing or the tests continue.

In this first part of the class, we will do observing experiments. 
 
The goal is to design experiment to observe phenomena, find patterns. 
The observations can be qualitative but more often we will collect numerical data. Collecting data and visualizing it properly will enable us to better quantify the patterns that may see. 

### Lab 2 - "Slowing Down"

**Phenomenon to Observe.**

The acceleration of an object sliding (in 1 dimension) to come to a stop due to a friction.

**Primary Guiding Question**

Often scientist have such questions in mind before they start observing. In  this class, our guiding questions will ensure that we are not straying too far from one another. 

1. Is there a statistically significant difference between the acceleration during sliding of the IOLab (on the felt pads) for a small push compared to a big push?

We will soon discuss how to do the "statistically significant" part properly. The following video demonstrate the big versus small push. Yes this is a very simple experiment!
