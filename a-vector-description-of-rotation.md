## A Vector Description of Rotation

Up to now, it has been sufficient to do rotation with the convention of + for counterclockwise and - for clockwise. 
As we turn to the very last piece, angular momentum, we need to develop a vector description of rotation. 

And rotation needs to be fully three dimensional, we will use the standard x,y, z coordinate.

As we have discussed already in the labs, angular velocity can be described as a vector. The direction is giving by the right hand rule.

Â The x-y-z coordinate system is right-handed. The positive direction of z is found by using the right hand wrapping from x to y and the thumb is in the +x direction. It then goes cyclically, y to z, thumb in in positive x. z to x, thumb is in positive y

For example for a rotation clockwise in the x-y plane.

Applying the right-hand rule to this rotation, we find that the angular velocity
