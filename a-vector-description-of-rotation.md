## A Vector Description of Rotation

Up to now, it has been sufficient to do rotation with the convention of + for counterclockwise and - for clockwise. 
As we turn to the very last piece, angular momentum, we need to develop a vector description of rotation. 

As we have discussed already in the labs, angular velocity can be described as a vector. The direction is giving by the right hand rule.

For example for a rotation clockwise in the x-y plane.
