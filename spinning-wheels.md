In the last question, the torque was in the same direction as the angular momentum. When that happens, the object just speeds up (if torque is parallel to angular momentum) or slow down (for anti-parallel). 

If the direction of the torque and angular momentum are not the same, then the **plane of rotation" will also change. 

This can lead to particularly intricate motion. The gyroscope (section 12.12 we DO NOT cover) is an interesting example. 

In this short video, I apply a torque by pushing up on the edge of a spinning bicycle wheel. This makes the wheel turn around. I can change the direction of the turn by changing where I apply the force and thus changing the direction of the torque.
