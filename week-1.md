## Lesson Objectives for week 1A

Physics is rocket science! By the end of this course you will be able to describe and explain the broad features of rocket motion/

But first, we need to describe and analyze motion. The lessons objectives for this (half) week are

LOProc01, LOProc03, LoVec02, LOKin01

* LOPro01: read and interpret graphs and data
* LOPro03: work with and convert units
* LOVec02: graphically perform vector arithmetic
* LOKin01: translate descriptions of motion into motion diagrams and vice versa


The full list of objectives can be found on Canvas. The reading for this week is Chap 1 of the textbook but read these course content page until you get the "read the textbook sign".
