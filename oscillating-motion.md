## Oscillations: 

We ended last week with constant acceleration 

If the acceleration is not constant, the general kinematics relationships still holds.

 The kinematics equations s-v-v^2 do not hold if the acceleration is not constant.

### Oscillating motion 

Oscillatory motion is the primary example that we will study in this class of a **non-constant acceleration motion.**

Your book covers oscillatory motion in one chapter at the end. In this class, we will introduce oscillatory motions gradually as we go along. For the moment, we are only interested in the kinematics of oscillatory motion, section 15.1 and the beginning of section 15.4.

Read carefully your book and my chapter review. We will limit our analysis to simple harmonic motion where the motion is sinusoidal.

### Check your Understanding. 

The first question is particularly important since this is a common misunderstanding regarding the notion of what is a full cycle.

Rad for radian is not a real unit and it is sometimes omitted. It is there to remind us that when you multiply the angular frequency by a time, you get an angle and that angle is in radians, not degrees. Be careful to use rad on your calculator when relevant in your calculations.

### The Period does not depend on the amplitude. 

One of the most important properties of harmonic oscillator is that the amplitude and the period (or frequency) are independent. You can change the amplitude as much as you want and the period stays the same. 

We illustrates this fact in the following video using a pendulum.

This is why pendulum are often used to keep track of time. Even though the amplitude of the oscillations decreases, the period stays the same and the pendulum keeps track of time!
