A net torque causes a change in angular momentum. 

<lrn-math>\vec{tau}_{net} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} </lrn-math>.

This means that in the absence of a net torque. The angular momentum is conserved. 

<lrn-math> \sum \vec{L}_i = \sum \vec{L}_f </lrn-math>

Just like when we did momentum, conservation of angular momentum problem require

* define carefully the system, for angular momentum to be conserved, there must be no external net torque on the system. There can be forces as long as they don't do torque or as long as all the torque cancel. 
* Since collisions are brief, often external torque are negligible in collisions because they give an negligible impulse over the short time of the collision
* Define a before and an after. 
* sum all the angular momenta of all particle/object before 
* sum all the angular momenta of all particle/object after
* put them equal to each other. This is a vector equation.

Conservation of angular momentum problems may combine point particles where one need to use <lrn-math> \vec{L} =\vec{r}\times \vec{p} </lrn-math> with rigid bodies where one need <lrn-math>\vec{L} = I\vec{omega}
