## Conservation of Angular Momentum

A net torque causes a change in angular momentum. 

<lrn-math>\vec{\tau}_{net} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} </lrn-math>.

This means that in the absence of a net torque. The angular momentum is conserved. 

<lrn-math> \sum \vec{L}_i = \sum \vec{L}_f </lrn-math>

This has many interesting and strange consequences. Look at this chair spin videos.

### Problem solving with conservation of angular momentum 

Just like when we did momentum, conservation of angular momentum problems require you

* define carefully the system and the pivot of interest. For angular momentum to be conserved, there must be no external net torque around that pivot on the system. There can be forces as long as they don't do torque or as long as all the torques cancel. 
* Since collisions are brief, often some external torque are negligible in collisions because they give an negligible impulse over the short time of the collision.
* Define a before and an after. 
* sum all the angular momenta of all particles/objects before 
* sum all the angular momenta of all particles/objects after
* put them equal to each other and solve. This is a vector equation.

Conservation of angular momentum problems may combine point particles where one need to use <lrn-math> \vec{L} =\vec{r}\times \vec{p} </lrn-math> with rigid bodies where one need <lrn-math>\vec{L} = I\vec{omega}
