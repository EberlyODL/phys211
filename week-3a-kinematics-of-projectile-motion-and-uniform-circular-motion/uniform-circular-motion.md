As usual, read carefully textbook section 4.4 and 4.5. Paraphrasing and doing the examples along the way. Also look at my chapter summary. 

### Angular variables. 

We will consider uniform circular motion so <lrn-math inline>\omega </lrn-math> is constant. There is no angular acceleration yet.

We will come back to non-uniform circular motion later.

The relation between angular velocity and angular displacement is the same as the relation between v and x. Direction matters!

We will take counter clockwise rotation to be positive and clockwise rotation to be negative but this is a convention.

### Connecting angular variables to linear variables

For circular motion, we will not use the x-y coordinate system that we have been using up to now. Instead we will talk about radial (r) and tangential (t) direction. the radial direction points toward the center of the circle. This is really a coordinate system that spins with the motion.

The connection between linear variable (in the rt coordinate system) and angular variables <lrn-math inline>\theta, \omega </lrn-math> can be summarized as follows.

The tangential acceleration <lrn-math inline>a_t </lrn-math> is zero for now because we are dealing with uniform circular motion only.

The derivation of these formulas are not particularly important.
