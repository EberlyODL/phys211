Mathematical aside. Proportional Reasoning. Read ahead to page 118 Mathematical aside in Chap 5. 

Two quantity are proportional when there is a direct relation between like
<lrn-math inline>
x=2y </lrn-math>

If there was an extra term such as <lrn-math inline>x = 2y+2 </lrn-math>. x and y would not be proportional.

Proportional are nice because one can quickly predict what happens to x when y changes. For example, in the previous relation, if y is double, x is also doubled.

A relation is proportional if the ratio of y/x is a constant. In our example it was 1/2. 

Ok this is pretty easy... What about <lrn-math inline>x = 6\sqrt{y} </lrn-math>. Is that proportional? yes it is but not between x and y. Instead we have a proportional relationship between <lrn-math inline> x </lrn-math> and <lrn-math inline> \sqrt{y} </lrn-math>. But this is still really useful. It means the ratio <lrn-math inline>\sqrt{y}/x </lrn-math> is a constant. If we double y, x will change by <lrn-math inline>\sqrt{2} </lrn-math>

Read carefully the mathematical aside in Chap 5 and try these questions.
