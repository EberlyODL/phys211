Projectile motion is a good example of 2D motion that is decomposed into 2 1D motion. A free fall in the y direction and a uniform motion in the x direction. 

Conceptually, there is really nothing new so this is a good spot to simply "amp up" our problem solving skills and our conceptual understandings of kinematics.

Here is in one image a summary of projectile motion.

The large number of variables in projectile motion require you to be well organized when solving problems. It also means that there is a larger set of possible questions and problems. You cannot hope to memorize all problems but you can and should learn the problem solving techniques.

## Read carefully the textbook
 

* first read section 4.2 before example 4.4 and paraphrase it in your mind (write notes on paper). 
* try to do example 4.4 on your own without looking at the solution (block it with a piece of paper or take a picture of just the question) and rewrite the question in your own words and solve it.  
* check the answer (its 28.6 m)
* if you got it right check the solution
* if you got it wrong, look at what you did and try to fix it.
* if in 5 minutes you can't fix check the solution
* finish reading section 4.2, paraphrasing along the way in your mind or on paper.  Pay close to attention to Model 4.1 and Problem solving strategy 4.1.
* try to do example 4.5 the same manner that you did 4.4
* finish reading and check your understanding with the stop to think
