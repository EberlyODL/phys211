The large number of variables in projectile motion require you to be organized when solving problems. It also means that there is a larger set of possible questions and problems. You cannot hope to memorize all problems but you can and should learn how to solve problems. 

Look carefully at Model 4.1 and Problem solving strategy 4.1

Do carefully example 4.4 and 4.5. Again the way to do examples problem in the book aer 



* first read section 4.2 before example 4.4 and paraphrase it in your mind (write notes on paper)
* try to do example 4.4 on your own without looking at the solution (block it with a piece of paper or take a picture) and rewrite the question in your own words and solve it.  
* check the answer (its 28.6 m)
* if you got it right check the solution
* if you got it wrong, look at what you did and try to fix it.
* if in 5 minutes you can't fix check the solution
* finish reading section 4.2, paraphrasing
* try to do example 4.5 the same manner that you did 4.4
* check your understanding with the stop to think
