<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
As in all parts of the course, your primary source of information is the book. Make sure to read carefully and do the worked out example without looking at the solution first. Examples 8.3 and 8.4 and surrounding text are crucial and they will not be discussed anywhere else. STOP at the end of section 8.4. We will not do section 8.5 until later.
