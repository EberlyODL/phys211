Projectile motion is a good example of 2D motion that is decomposed into 2 1D motion. A free fall in the y direction and a uniform motion in the x direction. 

Conceptually, there is really nothing new so this is a good spot to simply "amp up" our problem solving skills and our conceptual understandings of kinematics.
