Projectile motion is a good example of 2D motion that is decomposed into 2 1D motion. A free fall in the y direction and a uniform motion in the x direction. 

Conceptually, there is really nothing new so this is a good spot to simply "amp up" our problem solving skills and our conceptual understandings of kinematics.

Here is in one image a summary of projectile motion.

The vertical and horizontal motion are independent from each other but time links them. The vertical motion (hitting the ground) is what usually ends the projectile motion (in the absence of obstacle). Therefore the vertical motion is what you should use first to determine the time.
