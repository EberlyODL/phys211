The primary source of information for this course is the textbook. 


There are no good reasons for me to rewrite some part or say it aloud in a video. It is much better if instead I focus on teaching to skill to properly find and learn the material from reading the textbook.

In week1B, I will discuss specific learning strategies and this will include an how-to guide in how to read the textbook. 

I will provide a Chapter Summary (pdf on Canvas) and I will often have a few examples in these pages to illustrate some of the material covered. 

> The examples on this webpage are in no way exhaustive. If its in the textbook in an assigned readings, then it is covered in the course and it will be practice in the assignments and evaluated in the exams.
