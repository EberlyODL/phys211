The primary source of information for this course is the textbook. Here we will have a short guide on what to pay particular attention to when you read the textbook. 

# Chap 1. Concepts of Motion

## Representation and Models

This chapter introduces **representations** which are ways to represent knowledge about situation. 

* _verbal representation_: Using words to describe
* _pictorial representation_: Drawing a picture of the situation (very important in physics!)
* _graphical representation_: Graphs are very important. 
* _mathematical representation_: We can use mathematics to relate physical concepts to one another

In physics we also use **models**

A model is a highly simplified picture of reality but ones that capture the essential features we want to study.
