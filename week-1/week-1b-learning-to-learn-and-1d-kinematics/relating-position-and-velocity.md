Back to the study of motion. This week we study the beginning of kinematics in 1D. Our goal is to setup tools to quantitatively described motion. 

You can look at my chapter summary for Chap 2.1-2.3 but it very brief and succinct. It is meant to be this way. As in week 1, the notes in this course content are just meant to illustrate and clarify some concepts but the main source content is in the book. 

In particular, I will no do "problem solving videos". Why? Because there are examples in the book and if I do example videos, you may feel you do not need to read the book. Also just listening to an example rarely do any good and may in fact do harm by giving false sense of security. 

Now you may say that you already have been reading through the example problems and you want more. Be careful, quantity is not what matter its how you do the example that matter. 

Remember from the "How to read the textbook" page. Do not read example solution at all. 
1. You read the example question ONLY.
2. You take a piece of paper and try to solve it, without looking at the solution. 
3.  You may need to study the material (look at problem solving strategy or tactic box). 
4. You may need to struggle, abandon one way and try another. This is good. This is learning. 
4. Compare just your solutions. If its the same, great, now look at what the author did. If nots the same, look back at your process first and try to find where you could have gone wrong. 
5. If after 2 attempts (say 1/2 hour at least), it does not work look at the solution provided by the author. 


** Some might say, but what if when I first read the chapter, I read the example problem. How can I do them for real. It most probably does not matter, redo the example problem the next day or even earlier with the method above. Just by reading (or by watching a video online), you do not really assimilate the material so it
