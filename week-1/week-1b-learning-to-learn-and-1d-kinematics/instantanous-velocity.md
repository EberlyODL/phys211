Instantaneous velocity at a given time is the slope of the position-versus-time graph at that time. 

A slope upward is positive while a slope downward is negative. 

Displacement in a given time _interval_ can be obtained from the area between the position-versus-time curve and the time axis during that time _interval_. 

Area above the time axis are positive while area below the time axis are negative.

### Derivatives and Integrals

Almost all position-versus time curves or velocity-versus-time curves can be expressed as functions of time $x(t)$ and $v(t)$. In this course, most of the time, these functions will be a sum of polynomials in time of the form 

$x(t) = a + bt+ ct^2 +d t^3 +....$
where $a,b,c,d,...$ are constants that could be zero. 

As you will learn in more details in Math 140 - Calculus and as explained in our textbook in more details, the derivative and the integral are what allows us to compute instantaneous slope and areas. Read carefully your book (2.1-2.3) on both and then check your understanding here.
