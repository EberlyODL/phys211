Instantaneous velocity at a given time is the slope of the position-versus-time graph at that time. 

A slope upward is positive while a slope downward is negative. 

Displacement in a given time _interval_ can be obtained from the area between the position-versus-time curve and the time axis during that time _interval_. 

Area above the time axis are positive while area below the time axis are negative.
