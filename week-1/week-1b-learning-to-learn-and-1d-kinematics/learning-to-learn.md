### Phys 211 is harder that highschool physics

 * The course goes at a much faster pace. 
 * The material is conceptually more difficult and cumulative.
 * The problems can be more involved. 
 * The tests are less straightforward and will require you to **apply** several concepts at one time. 

You may have to change the way you learn and the way you work to attain the goals that you have set for yourself. Even if you are well versed in "how to learn", you should remember that even the best athletes have coaches. There is always room for improvement!

 
### What is success? What is failure? 

Success in my course is not defined by your course grades. Success is measured by how much you gain and how much you grew as a person through the course. Yes it sounds cheesy but it is always worth repeating. While we all have different stories and all come from different backgrounds, the path ahead is ours to make.

I have in the past refused to write letters of recommendation for A students because I had nothing to say. The students came in with perfect scores and left with perfect scores. Nothing wrong with that, but how much of a success is it to come in a course mostly knowing the subject and leaving with mostly the same knowledge?

For other students, this course was a real challenge. They had to struggle continuously and some of them were trying to avoid dire consequences such as losing financial aids or not being admitted in their major of choice. For some of them the hard work pays off and that makes a great success story. 

Others may not get the grade they need for entering a specific major and may have to chose something else. Some may leave school and come back or leaves school and then life happens! If later you remember this course fondly (I know with physics in the title!) and if you remember trying hard and learning things, then it was a success.  

The only real failure is the failure to try. 
   
Now, having said that, I would like everyone to get an A. While unlikely, this is technically possible, the grade scale is fixed and subsequent exams are not made harder after early success.
