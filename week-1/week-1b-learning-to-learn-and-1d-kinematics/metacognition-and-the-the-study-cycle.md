### Metacognition and becoming a self-directed learner

Metacognition is like having your brain looking from the outside at your own brain. Its the ability to think about one's own thinking.

Novice in a field tend to be overconfident on their mastery of the material. This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect. * I have seen this so many times.

To be successfull student, you need to think about your own thinking by doing the following

* **Assess**: You need to assess the task. What is required of you, what is the level of skills that will be needed. Is remembering enough or will you need to apply and analyze?
* **Evaluate**: Figure out your strengths and weaknesses. What do you already have? What are you missing?
* ** Plan**: Accounting for the current situation, given time constraints make the best plan to do the task at the level required. 
* ** Apply** and **Monitor**: Apply strategies (see below) and monitor continuously your performance. 
* ** Reflect**: Reflect on your performance, restart the cycle, re-assess the talk, evaluate and plan.
