### Reading a physics textbook. 

Unfortunately, you cannot read your physics textbook like would you read Harry Potter. There is a process here that works. 

#### Step 1: Previewing

1. Read the Chapter preview at the beginning and scan the whole chapter by reading just the title of each section. The goal is to get what the big picture. 
2. Once you have the big picture. Make a list of questions that you have about that subject (think personal life if you can, deeper processing). This will give you a motivation to read the text but you will also be searching for something which will make you much more attentive to all the details. 
3. Paraphrase. Regularly stop yourself and paraphrase (in your mind or own paper) what the paragraph you just read is about. As you add more paragraph, keep adding to your own story. This may seem long but most students say that it ends up less long. Why? In their own words... " I don't have to reread or having a bunch of false starts. 
4. Supplement the last 3 points with various activities such as 
    * highlighting 
    * taking notes
    * concept map (see
