### Reading a physics textbook. 

Unfortunately, you cannot read your physics textbook like would you read Harry Potter. There is a process here that works. 

1. Read the Chapter preview at the beginning and scan the whole chapter by reading just the title of each section. The goal is to get what the big picture. 
2. Once you have the big picture. Make a list of questions that you have about that subject (think personal life if you can to get to deeper processing). This will give you a motivation to read the text but you will also be searching for something which will make you much more attentive to all the details. 
3. Paraphrase. Regularly stop yourself and paraphrase (in your mind or own paper) what the paragraph you just read is about. As you add more paragraph, keep adding to your own story. This may seem long but most students say that it ends up less long. Why? In their own words... " I don't have to reread or having a bunch of false starts". Turtle and the hare, slow and steady wins the race.  
4. Supplement the last 3 points with various activities such as 
    * highlighting (do this right, not whole sentences. Just key nouns and verbs). 
    * taking notes
    * concept map (see <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/concept-map">Concept map explained</a>) 


** a side note on learning styles. One of the discovery of cognitive psychology is that learning style do not really exist. Everyone learn in the same way. The strategies I discuss in these pages are universal.

### Doing reading quiz, tutorial and quiz for real

The book is there for you to learn the material but it is not a cane. When you are actually solving problems, it is best to actually close the book and try on your own.  Use the formulae sheet but close the book. It is ok (and good) to struggle on a question for a while, try different methods. Do not be too quick on the draw to get your book or (worse) google. Struggle, try various things. Maybe contact me or your peers. Eventually, look back at examples in book. 
    
### Intense Study Cycle. 

Now you have read the book and you did the reading quiz.  You have done other practice questions at the end of the book. Its now time to study for the weekly quiz or the exam or the tutorial. You should study frequently as you cannot do effective studying all in one day. 

Studying does not have to be long, it just has to be intense and on task (no TV, no music!). 

|Steps|Time|Activity|
|---|---|---|
|Set a goal| 1-2 min| Decide what you want to accomplish in your study session|
|Study with focus|30-50 min| Interact with material: elaborate, compare, organize, summarize|
|Reward yourself| 10-15 min| Take a break, call/text a friend, play a short game, eat a snack|
|Review| 5 min| Go over what you just studied
