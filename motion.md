# Chap 1. Concepts of Motion

## Representation and Models

This chapter introduces **representations** which are ways to represent knowledge about situation. 

* _verbal representation_: Using words to describe
* _pictorial representation_: Drawing a picture of the situation (very important in physics!)
* _graphical representation_: Graphs are very important. 
* _mathematical representation_: We can use mathematics to relate physical concepts to one another

In physics we also use **models**

A model is a highly simplified picture of reality but ones that capture the essential features we want to study. 

## Particle Model

in this first part of the course (till Chap 12), we will represent object by a single point particle. Usually, the position of the particle is at the center of mass of the object as we will define more carefully later. 

This is a good **model** of a real life situation when the shape of the object it not something that is changing or having any effects on the overall motion.  Or it might just be that we are not interested in keeping track of the shape to answer the physical question of interest.  

## Time, Position and Displacement. 
 
We will use SI units of second (s) and meter (m)

Position <lrn-math>\vec{r}</lrn-math> is a **vector**: it has a direction and a magnitude. 

Displacement <lrn-math>\Delta\vec{r} = \vec{r}_f-\vec{r}_i</lrn-math> is the **difference** between two vectors. 

> Look carefully at vector addition and vector subtraction Tactics Box 1.1 and Tactics Box 1.2. 
Geometric vector subtraction Tactics Box 1.2 may the hardest part of this chapter. We will come back to this!!
