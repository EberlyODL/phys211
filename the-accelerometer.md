### Measuring Acceleration

In this class we will measure acceleration in two different ways use the IOLab device. In the first we use the wheel sensor. The wheel sensor really measures the position as a function of time. The software can then easily deduced the rate of change of position as a function of time (velocity) and the rate of change of velocity as function of time, the acceleration. 

This is called the coordinate acceleration and this is the only definition of acceleration we will learn in this class except that its not what an accelerometer measures!

### The accelerometer. 

The accelerometer is a tiny microelectromechanical system (short is mems). It is essentially a mass on a spring but a microscopic mass, and the spring compression/extension lead to tiny change in electrical output that can be amplified and measured.
