When one rolls without slipping, the point of contact must have exactly zero velocity. This implies a relationship between the velocity of the center of mass and the angular velocity of rotation to be

At each point on the wheel, the motion is the sum of the translation and the rotation. So the velocity vector at point P (from the first conceptual question on the previous page is.
