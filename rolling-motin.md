## Rolling Motion

When one rolls without slipping, the point of contact must have exactly zero velocity. This implies a relationship between the velocity of the center of mass and the angular velocity of rotation to be 

</lrn-math>v_{cm} =\omega R </lrn-math>

At each point on the wheel, the motion is the sum of the translation and the rotation. So the velocity vector at point P (from the first conceptual question on the previous page is.

In rolling motion, the kinetic energy is a combination of translation and rotation. 

<lrn-math> K_{rolling} = \frac12 I_{cm}\omega^2 + \frac12 mv_{cm}^2 </lrn-math>. Read carefully the section of the your textbook "The great downhill race" and here is a video displaying this race!

## yo-yo physics
Imagine you pull a yo-yo from underneath. The yo-yo is resting on a table.
