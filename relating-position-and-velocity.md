Back to the study of motion. This week we study the beginning of kinematics in 1D. Our goal is to setup tools to quantitatively described motion. 

You can look at my chapter summary for Chap 2.1-2.3 but it very brief and succinct. It is meant to be this way. As in week 1, the notes in this course content are just meant to illustrate and clarify some concepts but the main source content is in the book. 


In particular, I will not do "problem solving videos". Why? Because there are examples in the book and if I do example videos, you may feel you do not need to read the book. Also just listening to an example rarely do any good and may in fact do harm by giving false sense of security. 

Now you may say that you already have been reading through the example problems and you want more. Be careful, quantity is not what matter its how you do the example that matter. 

Remember from the "How to read the textbook" page, the best way to do examples. Let me repeat it here.

1. First, you read the example questions ONLY.
2. You take a piece of paper and try to solve it, without looking at the solution. 
3.  You may need to study the material, read the text before the example. Pay particular attention to problem solving strategies or tactic boxes. 
4. You may need to struggle, abandon one way and try another. This is good. This is learning. 
4. If you get the answer, compare just the solutions to the one in the book. If its the same, great, now look at what the author did. If its not the same, look back at your process first and try to find where you could have gone wrong. 
5. If after 2 attempts (say 1/2 hour at least), it does not work look at the solution provided by the author. You will need to try a similar problem again to make sure you can do it without help.  

** Some might say, but what if when I first read the chapter, I read the example problem. How can I do them for real after that? It most probably does not matter, redo the example problem the next day or even earlier with the method above. Just by reading (or by watching a video online), you do not really assimilate the material so you will forget it anyhow. 

## Average vs Instantaneous.

So we are in 1D, using the symbol $s$ to denote either $x$ (horizontal) or $y$ (vertical) motion. 


We have defined the average velocity in the s direction to be the displacement in the $s$ direction $\Delta s= s_f-s_i$
 
$v_{avg,s} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$

Try the following two questions to make sure you are good with this definition.

Questions about average can get tricky when the motion has multiple different parts. You may have to do some work to find the displacement.

### Example

A car moves east at 30mph for 2 hours and then back west at 50mph for 2 hours. What was the average velocity. 

First find the displacement. We moves east 60miles (30 *2) then west 100 miles. So the displacement (final - initial) will be -40 miles. We did that in 4hours so the average velocity is -10mph.
