## Relating Position and Velocity. 

Back to the study of motion. This week we study the beginning of kinematics in 1D. Our goal is to set up tools to quantitatively described motion. 

Remember from the "How to read the textbook" page, the best way to do examples. Let me repeat it here.

1. First, you read the example questions ONLY.
2. You take a piece of paper and try to solve it, without looking at the solution. 
3. You may need to study the material, read the text before the example. Pay particular attention to problem solving strategies or tactic boxes. 
4. You may need to struggle, abandon one way and try another. This is good. This is learning. 
4. If you get the answer, compare just the solutions to the one in the book. If its the same, great, now look at what the author did. If its not the same, look back at your process first and try to find where you could have gone wrong. 
5. If after 2 attempts (say 1/2 hour at least), it does not work look at the solution provided by the author. You will need to try a similar problem again to make sure you can do it without help.  

** Some might say, but what if when I first read the chapter, I read the example problem? How can I do them for real after that? 

It most probably does not matter, redo the example problem the next day or even earlier than that with the method above. Just by reading (or by watching a video online), you do not really assimilate the material so you will forget it anyhow. 

## Uniform Motion

Anne-Sylvie Deutsch is a former graduate student at Penn State (now its Dr. Deutsch). She will help me demonstrates some of the physics that we will see in this course through some (something silly demonstration video)

The simplest kind of motion to analyze is the one of constant velocity, constant speed and direction. This is called uniform motion.

## Average vs Instantaneous.

So we are in 1D, using the symbol <lrn-math>s</lrn-math> to denote either <lrn-math>x</lrn-math> (horizontal) or <lrn-math>y</lrn-math> (vertical) motion. 

We have defined the average velocity in the s direction to be the displacement in the <lrn-math>s</lrn-math> direction <lrn-math>\Delta s= s_f-s_i</lrn-math>
 
<lrn-math>v_{avg,s} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}</lrn-math>

Try the following two questions to make sure you are good with this definition.

Questions about averages can get tricky when the motion has multiple different parts. You may have to do some work to find the displacement.

### Example

A car moves east at 30 mph for 2 hours and then back west at 50 mph for 2 hours. What was the average velocity? 

First find the displacement. We move east 60 miles (30 *2) then west 100 miles. So the displacement (final - initial) will be -40 miles. We did that in 4 hours so the average velocity is -10 mph.
