A general collision where both objects move initially and both objects move at the end has two unknown to solve for (two different final speed). 

To be able to find those final velocities, we would need to know something about the energy of the system. The general case is beyond the level of this course to solve in full but the case where kinetic energy is exactly conserved can be solved. 

This is the **completely elastic collision**. Even in this special scenario, we will further simplify by considering the case where object 2 is initially at rest. Then the final velocities of object 1 and 2 are 

<lrn-math inline> (v_{fx})_1=\frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}(v_{ix})_1 </lrn-math>

<lrn-math inline>(v_{fx})_2=\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}(v_{ix})_1</lrn-math>

As described in your book there are three very important special cases.
 
* Case A: equal masses. For example billiard balls
* Case B: object 1 is much more massive than 2. For example a truck runs into a tennis ball. 
* Case C: the reverse of B.  For example, a tennis ball collide against the wall.  

Here is a special sequence of two perfectly elastic collision both of type "Case C" that lead to dramatic bouncing.
