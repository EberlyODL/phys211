## Week 4 - Projectile Motion and Forces

## Lesson Objectives


* LOPro06: solve simultaneous linear equations
* LOKin08: apply kinematics projectile motion with no drag.
* LODyn00: identify the object/system of interest and all contact/long range forces acting it. 
* LODyn01: apply the idea that net forces are related to acceleration, not velocity 
* LODyn02: draw and use force diagrams (free-body diagrams) to analyze static and dynamic systems
