If the acceleration is constant, the integrals in the kinematics relations can be done directly and one obtains the following 3 useful equations.

Many problems in kinematics can be solved using these equations and these are even worth memorizing (but they are given in the formula sheet).

## Problem solving video

Question: An airplane starts at rest at one end of a runway. The pilot will abort the takeoff if the airplane
does not reach a certain percentage of its takeoff velocity by the time the plane is halfway along
the runway. For a plane known to reach takeoff velocity right at the end of the runway,
calculate this percentage. Assume that the plane has constant acceleration
