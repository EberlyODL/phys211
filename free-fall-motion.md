We often see objects falling with a different acceleration. A tennis ball drops directly to the ground while a feather takes it time and swing back and forth. Is there a pattern to the acceleration of falling objects, are there general rules. Does it depend on the shape on the object? Does it depend on the mass of the object?

It is with such guiding questions that Galileo Galilei set forth to investigate this phenomenon. His findings are still to day among important discoveries in all of science. 

1. In the absence of drag, the acceleration of an object in free fall is constant. 
2. The magnitude of the acceleration is <lrnmath>9.8 m/s^2</lrnmath>
