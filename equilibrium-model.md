Start by reading the textbook carefully using paraphrasing and do the examples without looking at the solutions. 

Also have a look at my chapter summary where I briefly condensed the material. 

There are a total of 11 worked examples in the textbook in chapter 6 and all of them are important (except the "challenged example" #11 which is a bit beyond what we will do in this class). The only way to learn dynamics is to practice it in multiple contexts. Make sure you look carefully at all exercises. Do them without looking at solutions. 

Section 6.1 to 6.3 discusses two models of Nature.  

1. **Mechanical equilibrium**. This is for objects where the net force is zero (or close to). The object could be at rest or moving at constant velocity and Newton's First law states that the sum of the forces should be zero <lrn-math inline> \vec{F}_{net} = \vec{0} </lrn-math>
2. **Constant force**. This is for objects on which the net force is constant. In this case there will be a constant acceleration in the same direction as the net force. One can use <lrn-math> \vec{F}_{net} =m\vec{a} </lrn-math> and the constant kinematic equation we have learned before.

Kinematics is still a crucial part of all of our problem solving skills. Since we will mostly work with the constant force model at first, we will get a constant acceleration. The question may be asking about velocity and position in which case we need to use constant acceleration kinematics to solve for these variables.

The problem solving strategy 6.1 is super important. In a nutshell it is. 

**Model**: the object as a dot and decide which force should be included or neglected. (use Tactics Box 5.2 to remember how to identify forces). 

** Visual**: You need a sketch, a coordinate systems (important!) and a free body diagram (look back at Tactics Box 5.3 on how to draw free-body diagram)

** Solve ** Write <lrn-math> \vec{F}_{net} =m\vec{a} </lrn-math> for each direction (x and y). Solve for acceleration or for forces. Use kinematics if needed. 

** Assess** Check units and whether the number make sense. 

### Mechanical equilibrium. 

In the following video, I illustrate the problem solving strategy.

Tips to remember from the video and your readings

* It is always good to tilt your coordinate axes to align as many forces as possible (or align with the acceleration vectors). 
* When we write Newton's Law in component forms, we write the magnitude of forces (like n and T) and put the sign directly in front (+ or -). We account for direction by using <lrn-math> \cos\theta </lrn-math> or <lrn-math> \sin\theta </lrn-math>
