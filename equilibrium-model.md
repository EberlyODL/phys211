## Read the textbook, Chap 6: Dynamics I

Start by reading the textbook carefully using paraphrasing and do the examples without looking at the solutions. If you want start with section 6.1 to 6.3 first, the read this page and next before start friction. 

There are a total of 11 worked examples in the textbook in this chapter and all of them are important. The only way to learn dynamics is to practice it in multiple contexts. Make sure you look carefully at all exercises. 

section 6.1 to 6.3 discusses two models of Nature. 

I remind you that models are really approximate description of real phenomena. 

1. Mechanical equilibrium. This is for objects where the net force is zero (or close to). The object could be at rest or moving at constant velocity and Newton's laws just state that the sum of the forces should be zero <lrn-math inline> \vec{F}_{net} = \vec{0} </lrn-math>
2. Constant force. This is for objects on which the net force is constant. In this case there will be a constant acceleration in the same direction as the net force. One can use <lrn-math inline> \vec{F}_{net} =m\vec{a} </lrn-math> and the constant kinematic equation we have learned before.

Kinematics is still a crucial part.
