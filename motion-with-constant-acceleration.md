The fan cart demonstration is an example of nearly constant acceleration motion. You may have been surprised by the answer to the previous question that the acceleration is to the left even though the cart is momentarily at rest at the turning point.

This is important. Acceleration does not have to be zero just because the velocity is zero. The velocity may be changing from a positive to a negative value.

We can add the velocity vectors to the Fan Cart motion diagrams. ** Remember that the velocity vectors are just proportional to the displacement vectors. **

The acceleration at the turning point is <lrnmath>\vec{a}_4 = \frac{Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}</lrnmath>. If we take the time interval to be 1 in whatever units (not important here) the acceleration vector can be found by vector substraction

Which is to the left. In fact we can find the acceleration vector at any point and we find that it always to the left and always the same size. Try it! To go from one velocity vector to the next you just add the acceleration vector and for this motion, you always the same quantity to the left.
