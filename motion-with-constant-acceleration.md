The fan cart demonstration is an example of nearly constant acceleration motion. You may have been surprised by the answer to the previous question that the acceleration is to the left even though the cart is momentarily at rest at the turning point.

This is important. Acceleration does not have to be zero just because the velocity is zero. The velocity may be changing from a positive to a negative value.

We can add the velocity vectors to the Fan Cart motion diagrams. ** Remember that the velocity vectors are just proportional to the displacement vectors. **

The acceleration at the turning point is <lrn-math>\vec{a}_4 = \frac{Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}</lrn-math>. If we take the time interval to be 1 in whatever units (not important here) the acceleration vector can be found by vector substraction

Which is to the left. In fact we can find the acceleration vector at any point and we find that it always to the left and always the same size. Try it! To go from one velocity vector to the next you just add the acceleration vector and for this motion, you always the same quantity to the left. The left portion of the figure below shows the velocity vector and acceleration vector at each time frame. Going from time 0 to 8, note how the acceleration vector is what you need to add to the previous velocity vector to get to next velocity vector.

This is an example of **constant acceleration motion**. The velocity-versus-time graph is a straight line (here with negative slope) and the acceleration-versus-time graph is a horizontal line.

Constant acceleration motion, just like uniform motion with zero acceleration, is a model that represents many motion in real life. It is never exactly true. Very often the acceleration change slightly due to perturbations. But it is a good approximation to model and study many features of real life situations.

### Other examples of constant acceleration motion

Two other important examples of constant acceleration motion are free fall (with no drag) and motion on an inclined plane with no friction. This is illustrated below as a back and forth motion but any part of the motion is constant acceleration. So just an object in free fall going downward will have constant acceleration.
