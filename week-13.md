## Lesson Objectives for week 13

* LOKin10: relate angular and linear kinematic variables for non-uniform circular motion
* LODyn10: analyze non-uniform circular motion in an inertial reference frame with no fictitious forces 
* LODyn11: extend dynamics ideas to rigid bodies (torque) 
* LONrg11: understand and use rotational kinetic energy
* LOB01: visualize & calculate the center of mass (COM) of an extended object or set of objects
* LOB02: understand motion in terms of the COM & use COM to determine motion of parts
* LOB03: visualize & calculate the moment of inertia around a fixed axis for a rigid object.
