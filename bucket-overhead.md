Here is a demo related to the last conceptual question with the turntable.

### The wall of death

We can also the "wall of death" situation in more details. Again this is the situation where you spin against a wall and the static friction is the only thing holding you up.

Applying Newton's Law in the z direction, we must have that 

<lrn-math> f_s = mg </lrn-math>

If the static friction is static it must be that <lrn-math>f_s = f_{s,max} =\mu_s n </lrn-math>. 

Interestingly the normal force is what provide the centripetal acceleartion. Newton's law in the r direction gives. 

<lrn-math> n = mv^2/r </lrn-math>

As you increase the velocity of the "wall of death", the normal force pushes harder on you. This also means that the max static friction increases and you are less likely to fall. As you lower the velocity, the normal decreases and the max static friction also decreases. If the max static friction is below the force of gravity, you fall. 
</lrndesign-sidenote>

So in the wall of death, there is a minimum speed. 


<lrn-math>f_s = mg < f_{s,max} = \mu_s n = \mu_s m v^2/r  </lrn-math>

or <lrn-math> v> \sqrt{\frac{gr}{\mu_s}} </lrn-math>.

This scenario will come back again and again. It is described in the book section 8.4 and I discussed it in this short video.
