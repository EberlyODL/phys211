Here is short demo about the two coins on the turntable.

### The wall of death

Again this is the situation where you spin and the static friction is the only thing holding you up.

Applying Newton's Law in the z direction, we must have that 

<lrn-math inline> f_s = mg <lrn-math inline> 

If the static friction is static it must be that <lrn-math inline>f_s = f_{s,max} =\mu_s n </lrn-math>. 

Interestingly the normal force is what provide the centripetal acceleartion. Newton's law in the r direction gives. 

<lrn-math inline> n = mv^2/r </lrn-math>

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
As you increase the velocity of the "wall of death", the normal force pushes harder on you. This also means that the max static friction increases and you are less likely to fall. As you lower the velocity, the normal decreases and the max static friction also decreases. If the max static friction is below the force of gravity, you fall.

So in the wall of death, there is a minimum speed. 


<lrn-math inline>f_s = mg < f_{s,max} = \mu_s n = \mu_s m v^2/r  </lrn-math>

or <lrn-math inline> v> \sqrt{\frac{gr}{\mu_s}} </lrn-math>.
