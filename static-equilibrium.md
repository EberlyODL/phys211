No new fundamental principle but the complexity of the problems increase. Look carefully at the three examples in this section. 


For an object to be in equilibrium we must use Newton's second law for linear motion ( <lrn-math>\vec{F}_{net} =\vec{0} </lrn-math>) and torque ( <lrn-math>\tau_{net} = 0 </lrn-math>). The torque equation must be checked for all pivots. In real life, there are obvious pivots that once checked, all other possible pivot are clearly also zero. 

### an interesting equilibrium situation is the cantilever. 

The cantilever is the idea of pushing down on some parts to hold the center of mass above nothing. 

The millenium science center on the University Park campus is a good example.

Let me illustrate how this work by doing the example of holding a pen.
