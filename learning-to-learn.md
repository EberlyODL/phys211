### Phys 211 is not an easy course!

 * The course goes at a fast pace. 
 * The material is conceptually difficult and cumulative.
 * The problems can be quite involved. 
 * The tests are not straightforward and will require you to **apply** several concepts at one time. 

You may have to change the way you learn and the way you work to attain the goals that you have set for yourself. Even if you are well versed in "how to learn", you should remember that even the best athletes have coaches. There is always room for improvement!

 
### What is success? What is failure? 

Success in my course is not defined by your course grades. Success is measured by how much you gain and how much you grew as a person through the course. Yes it sounds cheesy but it is always worth repeating. While we all have different stories and all come from different backgrounds, the path ahead is ours to make.

I have in the past refused to write letters of recommendation for A students because I had nothing to say. The students came in with perfect scores and left with perfect scores. Nothing wrong with that, but how much of a success is it to come in a course mostly knowing the subject and leaving with mostly the same knowledge?

For other students, this course was a real challenge. They had to struggle continuously and some of them were trying to avoid dire consequences such as losing financial aids or not being admitted in their major of choice. For some of them the hard work pays off and that makes a great success story. 

Others may not get the grade they need for entering a specific major and may have to chose something else. Some may leave school and come back or leaves school and do something else. If later you remember this course fondly (I know with physics in the title!) and if you remember trying hard and learning things, then it was a success.  

The only real failure is the failure to try. 
   
Now, having said that, I would like everyone to get an A. While unlikely, this is technically possible, the grade scale is fixed and subsequent exams are not made harder if the average on the first one is high!

As a professor, I see three things that I can do to transform your hard work into success on the exams. 

1. Offer help again and again. I am available and willing to help anyone. Make use of me and other resources. I completely understand that life happens, you do not need to apologize or to hide. If you are trying hard and working, I already consider you a successful student and I see my role as a coach to transform all those golf swings into a par or a birdie!

2. Teach you how to learn in general and how to learn physics 211 in particular. There are ways to make the most out of your study time. I believe it is more important for me to teach you how to learn something effectively than given you quick answers or marvelously clear explanations. In the next few pages, I will summarize techniques on how to **study smarter not harder**. I will come back to these strategies again and I will have questions on the quiz and on the exam about them, this material is covered as part of the course. These lessons are potentially more important (and may have more of an impact on your grade) then the actual physics lessons. 

3. Provide a well designed course to guide your learning experience. The learning is not happening in the textbook or in this course webpage, the learning is happening in your head and its not done by me, its done by you. My course is designed to get you to acquire the knowledge, do the connections in your brain and to practice the skills to the point of unconscious mastery (like driving a car or a bike).
