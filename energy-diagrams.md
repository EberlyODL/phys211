Not all forces can lead to potential energy. Potential energy can be extracted so it must be that when the objects come back to their initial position, the change in potential energy is zero. 

In terms of work this require that the work done on closed path is zero.

Only two forces satisfy this criteria in Phys 211 and they are called conservative forces. 

* Gravity with potential <lrn-math inline> U_G =mgy </lrn-math>
* Spring force with potential <lrn-math inline> U_{Sp} = \frac12 k\left(\Delta s\right)^2
