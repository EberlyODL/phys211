## Structure of the Lessons
[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4398|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=mediavideo]

The primary source of information for this course is the textbook. 

Many courses overload students with large amount of information much of which is not directly relevant to the learning objectives of the course. 

My goals are to 

* minimize the amount of superfluous information
* tailor the information that I provide to your needs
* give you the tools to learn
* teach you how to use those tools 

There will NOT be video lectures.  These have been demonstrated to NOT be an effective way to learn. I will make problem solving videos and I will frequently make videos on specific problems as they arise in the class assignments. 

Videos explanations are good (although not always the best option) when you are stuck and you are looking for a worked-out example. Fortunately we are blessed with a subject (physics, mechanics) with many such videos already existing on the web which you can google and consult if needed. 

The lessons of the course will first start with the assumption that you have read the textbook. For each week, I wrote a brief of summary of the most important concepts from the textbook. Then I will elaborate more on the important concepts within these course content pages. There will be demo videos, some problem solving videos and I will provide "check your understanding questions" with explanations. 

The course content pages also include all the material that is not covered in the textbook but needed for the class. This is mostly about "how to learn physics" and about "statistics and lab techniques".

The rest of the "lecture" will be in the form of discussion board and various assignments where feedback will be provided. It is very important to look at those feedback and act upon them to correct your errors. 

### Read the textbook

While reading the textbook, pay close attention to 

* **Model**: They are listed on the front cover page, for example the first model is uniform motion on page 35
* **Problem-solving strategy**: again listed on the front cover page
* **Tactics Box**: Short summary of important skills to master.  
* **Stop to think**: Short questions to test you understanding, do them! The answers are at the end of the book.

The examples on these webpages are in no way exhaustive. If it is in the textbook in an assigned readings, then it is covered in the course and it will be practiced in the assignments and evaluated in the exams.
