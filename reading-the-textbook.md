The primary source of information for this course is the textbook. 

There are no good reasons for me to rewrite some part or say it aloud in a video. It is much better if instead I focus on teaching you the skills to properly find and learn the material from reading the textbook.

While reading the textbook, pay close attention to 

* **Model**: They are listed on the front cover page, for example the first model is uniform motion on page 35
* **Problem-solving strategy**: again listed on the front cover page
* **Tactics Box**: Short summary of important skills to master.  
* **Stop to think**: Short questions to test you understanding, do them! The answers are at the end of the book. 

In week1B, I will discuss specific learning strategies and this will include an how-to guide in how to read the textbook. 

Instead of repeating the textbook with lectures notes or videos (which have been shown an ineffective way to learn), I wrote

1. Chapter Summary (pdf on Canvas). These chapter summaries are my own personal summary of the important concepts and tools for the week lessons.

2. Some course course content pages to illustrate via examples and real demo video some of the material covered. The pages include many "check you understanding questions". 

The course content pages include also all the material that is not covered in the textbook but needed for the class. This is mostly about "how to learn physics" and about "statistic and lab techniques".

The examples on these webpages are in no way exhaustive. If it is in the textbook in an assigned readings, then it is covered in the course and it will be practice in the assignments and evaluated in the exams.

Now is the time to read Chap 1 of your textbook! Then come back to read the next two pages.
