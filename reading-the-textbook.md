The primary source of information for this course is the textbook. 

Many courses overload students with large amount of information many of which is not directly relevant to the learning objectives of the course. 

My goals are to 

* minimize the amount of superfluous information
* tailor the information that I provide to your need
* give you the tools to learn and to teach you how to use those tools. 

There will NOT be video lectures which are not an effective use of your time to learn. I will make problem solving videos and I will frequently make a video on specific problems as they arise in the class assignments. 

Videos explanations are good (although rarely the best option) when you are stuck and you are looking for a worked out example. Fortunately we are blessed with a subject (phys mechanics) with many such videos on the web if needed. 

So the lessons of the course will first start with the assumption that you have read (in a particular method described below) the textbook. Then I will elaborate more on the important subject and provide "Check your understanding questions" with explanation and some problem solving video. 

While reading the textbook, pay close attention to 

* **Model**: They are listed on the front cover page, for example the first model is uniform motion on page 35
* **Problem-solving strategy**: again listed on the front cover page
* **Tactics Box**: Short summary of important skills to master.  
* **Stop to think**: Short questions to test you understanding, do them! The answers are at the end of the book. 

In week1B, I will discuss specific learning strategies and this will include an how-to guide in how to read the textbook. 

Instead of repeating the textbook with lectures notes or videos (which have been shown to be an ineffective way to learn), I wrote

1. Chapter Summary (pdf on Canvas). These chapter summaries are my own personal summary of the important concepts and tools for the week lessons.

2. Some course course content pages to illustrate via examples and real demo video some of the material covered. The pages include many "check you understanding questions". 

The course content pages include also all the material that is not covered in the textbook but needed for the class. This is mostly about "how to learn physics" and about "statistic and lab techniques".

The examples on these webpages are in no way exhaustive. If it is in the textbook in an assigned readings, then it is covered in the course and it will be practiced in the assignments and evaluated in the exams.

Now is the time to read Chap 1 of your textbook! Then come back to read the next two pages.
