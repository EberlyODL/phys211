### Reading Guide Chap 15. 

We have already discussed the basic of oscillatory motion in week 2A. Make sure to review this material.

Important shorthand notation

* SHM = simple harmonic motion
* SHO = simple harmonic oscillator

As usual, read slowly, paraphrasing. Do the exercise without first looking at the solution. 

section 15.2 on how to view SHM as circular motion is often confusing and we will practice this. 
  
In this class, we will skip the subsection "The physical pendulum in section 15.6. Do not do example 15.9 but the "Stop to think 15.5 is important and relates to earlier part of section 15.6. 

The challenge example 15.11 can be skipped.
