## Angular momentum

In the first part of this section, they discuss the angular momentum of a point particle. This is something unsettling to people but a particle moving on a straight line **will have** angular momentum with respect to a pivot that is not on that line. 

The formula is <lrn-math> \vec{L}=\vec{r}\times\vec{p} </lrn-math> which you could have guessed by analogy with torque. 

Just like it was possible to write Newton's law in terms of momentum <lrn-math> \vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} </lrn-math>, we can write the rotational analog <lrn-math>\tau =I\alpha </lrn-math> in terms of angular momentum. 

<lrn-math>\vec{tau}_{net} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} </lrn-math>.
