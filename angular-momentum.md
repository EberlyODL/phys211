In the first part of this section, they discuss the angular momentum of a point particle. This is something unsettling to people but a particle moving on a straight line **will have** angular momentum with respect to a pivot that is not on that line. 

The formula is <lrn-math> \vec{L}=\vec{r}\times\vec{p} </lrn-math> which you could have guessed by analogy with torque. 

Just like it was possible to write Newton's law in terms of momentum <lrn-math> \vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} </lrn-math>, we can write the rotational analog <lrn-math>\tau =I\alpha </lrn-math> in terms of angular momentum. 

<lrn-math>\vec{tau}_{net} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} </lrn-math>.

### Angular momentum

The angular momentum of a solid object along a axis of symmetry is 

<lrn-math>\vec{L}=I\vec{\omega} </lrn-math>

This equation is not true in general. It is only for rotation along an axis of symmetry. In this case, all rotation will be along axis of symmetry (which we are not even defining properly).
