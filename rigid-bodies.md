## Rigid bodies and Center of Mass

We are now ready to start the study of rotation of rigid bodies. 

To describe the motion of a rigid body, we need more than just the mass, we need to know about 

* Center of mass
* Momentum of inertia.

In this course we will not perform integrals like the one down in example 12.2, 12.5 and 12.6 so you can skip those problems although those skills will be needed in Phys 212 for very similar problems.

The 3 stop to think questions are great and so are the other examples. 

### Worked Example on Center of Mass. 


Let me do one extra worked example from what is in the book. Imagine the following situation. 

An projectile (mass <lrn-math>m_1</lrn-math>) explodes at the top of its trajectory (at <lrn-math>x=x_0</lrn-math>), breaking into two pieces – a small piece, <lrn-math>m_2</lrn-math>, and a larger piece, <lrn-math>m_3</lrn-math>, with <lrn-math>m_3 = 2m_2</lrn-math> – which fly apart horizontally. Surprisingly, the smaller piece falls back exactly at the launch site. Neglect air resistance and effects due to the earth’s curvature. 

How far away from the original launching  point does the larger piece land?
