### Reading Guide Chap 11 (11.1 to 11.5, NOT 11.6)

Important chapter with very important concepts! When going from energy to momentum we are back using vectors extensively.

Momentum is a vector unlike energy. An object really has 3 different momenta (momenta = plural of momentum). There is a momentum for each direction but only one amount of energy. As we will see all 3 momenta are independently conserved. Make sure to always check for the sign and the component in the momentum equation.

We will NOT cover 11.6 on rocket propulsion but feel free to read if you are curious. That means that example 11.10 is not covered but the challenge example 11.11 is covered.

Section 11.1-11.5 are on impulse and conservation of momentum. There are 9 worked examples for you to go through (10 with the challenge). Check my chapter summary after you read the textbook.
