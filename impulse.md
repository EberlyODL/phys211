### Reading Guide Chap 11 (11.1 to 11.5, NOT 11.6)

Important chapter with very important concepts. After doing energy we are back using vectors extensively.

Momentum is a vector unlike energy. An object really has 2 different momentum (in each direction) but only one amount of energy. As we will see all 3 momentum are independently conserved. Make sure to always for the sign int the momentum equation.

We will NOT cover 11.6 on rocket propulsion but feel free to read for the curious. 

Section 11.1-11.5 are on impulse, conservation of momentum.
