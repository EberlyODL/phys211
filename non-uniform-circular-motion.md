We now have all the tools to start studying the motion of extended objects moving beyond the single point particle approximation we have been using since the beginning of the course. 

We will still make an important approximation and that is the body is rigid. It will not deformed. When the body rotate, all points on the body have the same angular velocity <lrn-math>\omega </lrn-math>. 

When one goes beyond the particle model, it is possible for the object to both move and rotate.

The rotation is the new part and we will spend the next few weeks on this subject (chap 12). First we need to review the kinematic of uniform circular motion and extend to non-uniform circular rotation.

Paraphrasing and doing the examples along the way. Also look at my chapter summary. 

### Angular variables. 

Earlier in the course we introduce the concept of angular velocity which is the rate of change of angular displacement.

We will take counter clockwise rotation to be positive and clockwise rotation to be negative but this is a convention.

For a uniform circular motion, thats all there is but we very often the motion is not uniform and objects start rotating (or stop). In this case we can also have an angular acceleration denoted <lrn-math>\alpha </lrn-math> 

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4447|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image] 

If the angular acceleration is constant we get "constant acceleration equations

* <lrn-math>\Delta \theta =\omega_i\Delta t+\frac12 \alpha(\Delta t)^2 </lrn-math>
* <lrn-math>\omega_f = \omega_i +\alpha \Delta t</lrn-math>
* <lrn-math>\omega_f^2-\omega+i^2=2\alpha\Delta\theta </lrn-math>

### Connecting angular variables to linear variables

As before we can use linear variables instead of angular variables. We use the rtz coordinate system.

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4290|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]

The connection between linear variable (in the rt coordinate system) and angular variables <lrn-math>\theta, \omega, \alpha</lrn-math> can be summarized as follows.

 This is the same as before but we now have a tangential acceleration as well as a centripetal acceleration. The tangential acceleration just comes from the change in angular velocity.
