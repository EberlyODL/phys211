We will study the force of gravity in more details at the end of the course. 

For the moment we will use 

<lrn-math inline> F_G = mg </lrn-math>

with  <lrn-math inline>g = 9.80 m/s^2 </lrn-math> although we will use <lrn-math inline> g= 10 m/s^2 </lrn-math> in the exams to make it possible to do without calculator.
