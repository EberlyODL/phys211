Applying conservation of momentum in completely inelastic collision is relatively straigthforward and I have nothing to add beyond what is in the book.

Note that an explosion is just a completely inelastic collision in reverse.

In a completely inelastic collision, we must always have some of the initial kinetic energy converted into thermal energy. Similarly, an explosion always require a source energy from inside the system.

### Two balls drop. 

A general collision where both objects move initially and both objects move at the end has two unknown to solve for (two different final speed). 

To be able to find those final velocities, we need to know something about the energy of the system. The general case is beyond the level of this course but the case 
The completely elastic conserve energy
