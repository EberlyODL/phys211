Applying conservation of momentum in completely inelastic collision is relatively straightforward and I have nothing to add beyond what is in the book.

Note that an explosion is just a completely inelastic collision in reverse.

In a completely inelastic collision, we must always have some of the initial kinetic energy converted into thermal energy. Similarly, an explosion always require a source energy from inside the system.

In more than 1D, you must apply conservation for each direction independently.

In the image above, the initial momentum and some of final momentum are zero. This is **two** equations in x and y.

* The first equation says that the sum of all x momentum must cancel. Note that from the image that <lrn-math>p_1 </lrn-math> is straight down so it must be that <lrn-math>p_{2,x}=-p_{3,x} </lrn-math>


* The second equation says that the sum of the y momentum must cancel. Again in the special case of the image above we have directly that <lrn-math> p_{1,y} = -(p_{2,y}+p_{3,y}) </lrn-math>
