In non-uniform circular motion, we have a centripetal acceleration from the circular part and a tangential component. The net acceleration is the vector sum of these two accelerations. 

For example in the previous page "Check your understanding questions". Speeding in a CCW motion yielded an acceleration that points down and to the left if you are at the top.
