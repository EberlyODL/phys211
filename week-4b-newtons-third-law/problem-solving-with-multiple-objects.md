Beside the importance of understanding Newton's third law conceptually, it comes in crucially when solving dynamics problem with multiple objects interacting with one another. 

### Acceleration Constraints. 

In general, in a problem with multiple objects, each object would have its own acceleration <lrn-math inline>\vec{a}_A, \vec{a}_B, c\dots </lrn-math> When multiple objects are connected or in contact, the acceleration are often related in some ways. 

In the video below, I am solving the following problem. 

Consider two books: the lower book has mass <lrn-math inline> m_2 </lrn-math> and is resting on a nearly frictionless surface while the upper has mass <lrn-math inline> m_1 </lrn-math>. Suppose the coefficient of static friction between the books is <lrn-math inline>\mu_s </lrn-math>.

With what maximum force can the upper book be pushed horizontally so that the books move together without slipping?
