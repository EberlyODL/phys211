Beside the importance of understanding Newton's third law conceptually, it comes in crucially when solving dynamics problem with multiple objects interacting with one another. 

### acceleration constraints. 

In general, in a problem with multiple objects, each object would have its own acceleration <lrn-math inline>\vec{a}_A, \vec{a}_B, c\dots </lrn-math> When multiple objects are connected or in contact, the acceleration are often related in some ways.
