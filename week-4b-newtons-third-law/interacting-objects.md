As usual start by reading Chap 7 and do the examples without looking at solutions (paraphrase the concept). Read my chapter summary. The level of complexity in the problems really increase in this chapter and you may find that some of the examples are hard to do without help. 

Do not look at the worked out solutions, come read these pages, ask questions and try the examples again at a later time. 

In the next few page, I will elaborate more on the material. 

### Interacting object. (7.1-7.2)

In the following image, a runner uses a starting block to propel herself forward. 

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4319|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]

At the moment shown, the runner is only touching the starting block. This is one contact but since this is a surface, it will lead to two forces, a normal and a friction force. The friction force has to be static since there is no relative motion between feet and the block. The direction is uncertain at first. The static friction wants to oppose motion and my guess is that the runner must be pushing the block upward to get a friction downward. So the free-body diagram for the runner is

This is an example of **propulsion**. The runner is pushing on the block and the block pushes back. With friction and normal force both pointing to the right, we can get the biggest force to the right (which is the goal of the runner).

What would the free body diagram on the starting block look like?  The starting block touches the runner and the running track. Each will provide a normal and friction so there will be multiple normal and this gets really confusing!

Do not hesitate to label forces! Here we will use the full notation <lrn-math inline>F_{A\;on\;B} </lrn-math>

The objects in the problem are

|T|Track|
|EE| Entire Earth|

With this notation the free body diagram for the runner become
