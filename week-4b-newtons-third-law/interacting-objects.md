As usual start by reading Chap 7 and do the examples without looking at solutions (paraphrase the concept). Read my chapter summary. 

The level of complexity in the problems really increase in this chapter and you may find that some of the examples are hard to do without help.

### Interacting object. (7.1-7.2)

In the following image, a runner uses a starting block to propel herself forward.

There is only one contact but since this is a surface, it will lead to two forces, a normal and a friction force. The friction force has to be static since there is no relative motion between feet and the block. The direction is uncertain at first. The static friction wants to oppose motion and my guess is that the runner must be pushing the block upward to get a friction downward. So the free-body diagram for the runner is

This is an example of **propulsion**. The runner is pushing on the block and the block pushes back. With friction and normal force both pointing to the right, we can get the biggest force to the right (which is the goal of the runner).

What would the free body diagram on the starting block look like?  The starting block touches the runner and the ground. Each will provide a normal and friction force so there will be multiple similar forces. This can get really confusing!

Do not hesitate to label forces! Here we will use the full notation <lrn-math>F_{A\;on\;B} </lrn-math>
</lrndesign-sidenote>

The objects in the problem are

|Label|Object|
|---|
|R|Runner|
|B|Block|
|G|Ground|
|EE| Entire Earth|

With this notation the free body diagram for the runner becomes

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4321|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]

and the free body diagram for the starting block will be 

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4322|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
All the forces on the free-body diagram of the runner are "on R" while all the forces on the free-body diagram of the starting block are "on B". Make sure you put the forces at the correct place!
