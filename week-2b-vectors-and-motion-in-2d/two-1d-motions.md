If the acceleration vector  is constant (meaning the components do not change in time), we can integrate to find the velocity and position as a function of time for x and y independently.

In the following demo, we demonstrate how a projectile motion can be seen as free fall motion in the y direction (<lrn-math inline>a_y = -g </lrn-math>) and a constant uniform motion in the x direction(<lrn-math inline>a_x = 0 </lrn-math>) in the

A full analysis of projectile motion with various problem solving techniques will be the subject of next week. Projectile motion is not on midterm 1 but the idea that 2D motion can be decomposed as two 1D motion when the acceleration is constant is.

Again to reiterate, the yellow ball in the image below is doing a 1 dimensional free fall motion in the y direction (like the red ball) together with a uniform constant velocity motion in the x direction.
