Vectors are one of the main source of errors we see when students solve problems. 

**You should not only know the material of Chap 3, you should _master_ it to the point where it comes easily and quickly.**

I do not have much to add to the material beside the Chap3 summary I wrote (see in Canvas).

Â I reiterate that vectors components and unit vectors are by far the best way to do vector algebra and avoid mistake.

Khan academy has a great series of videos and exercises on vectors. Again, in this class, it is NOT enough to know and understand vectors. You must become so proficient with vector manipulation that your brain is spending no time on the vector algebra. All your thoughts are on the physics and not on the math.
