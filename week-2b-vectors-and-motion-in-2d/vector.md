Vectors are one of the main source of errors in problem solving. You should not only know the material of Chap 3, you should _master_ it where it comes easily and quickly. 

I do not have much to add to the material beside the Chap3 summary I wrote (see in Canvas).

Â I reiterate that vectors components and unit vectors are by far the best way to do vector algebra and void mistake.

Khan academy has a great series of videos and exercises on vectors. Again, in this class, it is NOT enough to know and understand vectors. You must become so proficient that your brain is spending no time on the vector parts. All your thoughts are on the physics and not the math.
