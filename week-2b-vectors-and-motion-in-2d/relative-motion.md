As mentioned in the video, motion is relative and different reference frame will measured different velocities

Read carefully the textbook for section 4.3 and my chapter summary. The ideas are simple but it can become quite confusing when solving problems. 

To avoid mistakes when solving relative motion problem it is really important to use the proper notation.

In problem solving is that the words, swim speed or airplane speed  usually refers to speed with respect to the medium. So swim speed is speed with respect to water while airplane speed is with respect to air. Often the water is also moving with respect to ground (current) while the air is moving with respect to ground (wind).
