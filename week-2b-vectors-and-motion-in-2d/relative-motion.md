The video above illustrates the independence of horizontal versus vertical motion.  Motion is relative and different reference frame will measured different velocities.

Read carefully the textbook for section 4.3. The ideas are simple but it can become quite confusing when solving problems.

Section 4.3 is a great place to do careful reading as we discussed in week 1B "Reading and Studying Methods". The method is as follows. 


* first read section 4.3 before example 4.6 and paraphrase it in your mind (write notes on paper). 
* try to do example 4.6 on your own without looking at the solution (block it with a piece of paper or take a picture of just the question) and rewrite the question in your own words and solve it.  
* check the answer (its 350 m/s)
* if you got it right check the solution
* if you got it wrong, look at what you did and try to fix it.
* if in 5 minutes you can't fix check the solution
* finish reading section 4.3, paraphrasing
* try to do example 4.7 and 4.8 in the same manner that you did 4.6
* check your understanding with the stop to think  

To avoid mistakes when solving relative motion problem it is really important to use the proper notation. 

Here is an example. In the following we have a car denoted C (or toy truck really) moving on a sheet of plastic (denoted S) which is itself moving with respect to the ground (G).

There are three different velocities and the relationship between them is

In problem solving, the words "swim speed or airplane speed"  usually refers to speed with respect to the medium. So swim speed is speed with respect to water while airplane speed is with respect to air. Often the water is also moving with respect to ground (current) while the air is moving with respect to ground (wind).

Typical problems in relative motion are crossing a river and distinguishing between the velocity relative to water and velocity relative to ground. These are very similar problems to the airplane problem example 4.7 and 4.8. 

Try to do both example 4.7 and 4.8 on your own before looking at Knight's solution.

Q. Rain is falling with a speed of 2 m/s with respect to the ground at angle of 30Â° from the vertical (counterclockwise from the -y axis; see picture). A car drives through the rain at a constant velocity, such that the rain appears to the driver of the car to be falling straight down along the vertical. What is the velocity of the car with respect to the ground?
