### Reading guide Chap 10: 

The concept of potential energy is probably the most abstract concept in this class. We will see only two types of potential energy

1. Gravitational Energy
2. Elastic energy (from spring force).

All energy problems depend on how you choose the system. If gravity or the spring force are external to the system, they do work. If they are internal forces, they create a potential energy within the system. Its one or the other and you choose which one it will be when you decide what the system under consideration will be.

As you will see, conservation of energy is very powerful to solve many problems that can be written as a before-and-after situations. 

Pay particular attention to the problem solving strategy 10.1

** Two new important tools

* _Bar charts_. very useful to keep track of energy. Do not be affraid to draw them very quickly. 
* _Energy diagrams:_ Also known as "potential energy curve". These are full of information. 

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
Energy problems are easy to solve and usually involve a single equation of the form initial energies = final energies. Nevertheless, the common mistake is to forget some form of energy in the equation. The use of bar charts greatly diminish these type of errors.

There are 11 worked examples. As usual, these are all important problems including the very last one, the "challenge". Make sure you do them without looking at solutions.

### Gravitational potential. 

As shown in your book, a system made of a mass m and the Earth has the following gravitational potential energy if the mass is near the surface of the Earth.

Some comments

* The Earth must be part of the system in consideration. If it was not, the gravitational force would be external and the Earth would be doing work on the mass. Treating the force as external and doing work is a fine and correct way to analyze the situation but then we cannot discuss potential energy. If gravity is external, it does work. If it is internal, we have potential energy. We never have both at the same time!
* This potential energy depends on the relative position of the mass and the Earth (on y). By moving the mass up, I increase the potential energy of the mass-Earth system. 
* Potential energy is stored in the gravitational field. We will not discuss this further in this class but we will return to this concept in Phys 212  when we will introduce the electric and magnetic fields. For now, you should know that the potential energy is spread out between the mass and the Earth in a physical, but not visible, very real and very important entity known as the gravitational field.
