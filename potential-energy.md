### Reading guide Chap 10: 

The concept of potential energy is probably the most abstract concept in this class. We will see only two types of potential energy

1. Gravitational Energy
2. Elastic energy (from spring force).

All energy problems depend on how you choose the system. If gravity or the spring force are external to the system, they do work. If they are internal forces, they create a potential energy within the system.

As you will see, conservation of energy is very powerful to solve many problems that can be written as a before-and-after situations. 

Look 

** Two new important tools

* Bar charts. very useful to keep track o


* the dot product between vectors. This is math. Probably new so we will practice it a lot. 
* Hooke's Law. This is really a new force, the spring force. We could have done this in Chap 6 but there was enough new stuff by then so its here now. This force is variable, it changes as the stretching/compressing changes. The spring force and Hooke's law is the subject of your lab in this unit.  

There are 11 worked examples. As usual, these are all important problems including the very last one, the "challenge". Make sure you do them without looking at solutions.
