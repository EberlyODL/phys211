### Reading guide Chap 10: 

The concept of potential energy is probably the most abstract concept in this class. We will see only two types of potential energy

1. Gravitational Energy
2. Elastic energy (from spring force).

All energy problems depend on how you choose the system. If gravity or the spring force are external to the system, they do work. If they are internal forces, they create a potential energy within the system.

As you will see, conservation of energy is very powerful to solve many problems that can be written as a before-and-after situations. 

Pay particular attention to the problem solving strategy 10.1

** Two new important tools

* _Bar charts_. very useful to keep track of energy. Do not be affraid to draw them very quickly. 
* _Energy diagrams:_ Also known as "potential energy curve". These are full of information. 

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
Energy problems are easy to solve and usually involve a single equation of the form initial energies = final energies. Nevertheless, the common mistake is to forget some form of energy in the equation. The use of bar charts greatly diminish these type of errors.

There are 11 worked examples. As usual, these are all important problems including the very last one, the "challenge". Make sure you do them without looking at solutions.
