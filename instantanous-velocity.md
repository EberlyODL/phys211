Instantaneous velocity at a given time is the slope of the position-versus-time graph at that time. 

A slope upward is positive while a slope downward is negative. 

Displacement in a given time _interval_ can be obtained from the area between the position-versus-time curve and the time axis during that time _interval_. 

Area above the time axis are positive while area below the time axis are negative. 

### Check your Understanding!

The last question contains the most difficult part. You have to remember that the area gives the displacement but the question may be asking for either the initial or final position, not necessarily just the displacement. 

### Derivatives and Integrals

Almost all position-versus time curves or velocity-versus-time curves can be expressed as functions of time <lrn-math>x(t)</lrn-math> and <lrn-math>v(t)</lrn-math>. In this course these functions will very often be sum of polynomials in time of the form 


<lrn-math>x(t) = a + bt+ ct^2 +d t^3 +....</lrn-math>
where <lrn-math>a,b,c,d,...</lrn-math> are constants that could be zero. 

Look at eq. 2.6 and 2.8 in book for how to take derivatives while look at 2.13 and 2.14 for integrals. 

As you will learn in more details in Math 140 - Calculus and as explained in our textbook in more details, the derivative and the integral are what allows us to compute instantaneous slope and areas. Read carefully your book (2.1-2.3) on both and then check your understanding here.

To do the last question you must use the 

<lrn-math>\Delta x = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} = v_x dt</lrn-math>

Make sure this is clear how to do!
